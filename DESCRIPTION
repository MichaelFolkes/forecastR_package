Description: ForecastR generates age-specific (or total abundance) forecasts of
    escapement or terminal run using a variety of generic models, enabling the
    users to perform the following interactive tasks with the help of SHINY 
    interface. These tasks include: 
    (a) the selection of forecasting approaches from a wide set of statistical 
    and/or mechanistic models for forecasting terminal run, escapement or 
    pre-fishery abundance (production); 
    (b) the selection of several measures of retrospective forecast performance 
    (e.g., MRE, MAE, MAPE, MASE, RMSE); 
    (c) the comparison of best forecasting models and model ranking based on the
    selected performance metrics; and, 
    (d) the reporting of forecasting results (point forecasts and interval 
    forecasts) and diagnostics by producing either a detailed report or an 
    executive-summary report.
