\usage{
prepData(datafile, out.labels = "v1")
}
\arguments{
\item{datafile}{datafile is a csv file in either the old format (withage
differs from withoutage) or the new format (all files have the same basic
format)}

\item{out.labels}{out.labels = "v1" to match what the old code uses for
N1,N3,N5. "v2" to match what old code uses for SIMPLESIBREG,
SIMPLELOGPOWER. This is necessary to retain old functions where possible.
Over the long-term, should fix this!}
}
\description{
This function takes replicates the steps from two functions
  datalist.XYZ.pre() datalist.XYZ(). NOTES datafile_extract_age_class() from
  simple sibreg does the same as the datalist.XYZ() from the naive models and
  the pre=code for that which is now in a new function	 datalist.XYZ.pre().
  However for SimpleSibReg (and SimpleLogPower?) the labels are different =>
  handling all this in the new prepData() module, with an options on the
  labels. it also incorporates a new data converter function for old and new
  data formats
